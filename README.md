## 🔍 Project Overview

1. **Load the SQL File**  
   - Open MySQL Workbench and load the `gdb080.sql` file.  
2. **Review the Queries**  
   - Refer to `sql_queries.docx` to understand each query and its intended purpose.  
3. **Identify Errors**  
   - Check for syntax errors, incorrect table joins, missing conditions, or logical mistakes.  
4. **Fix and Test**  
   - Modify the queries as needed and test them to ensure they return the correct results.
