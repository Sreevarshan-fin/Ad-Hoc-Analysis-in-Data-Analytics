# Ad-Hoc-Analysis-in-Data-Analytics

Ad hoc analysis is a powerful approach in data analytics, enabling on-the-spot problem-solving and quick decision-making. Unlike predefined reports, it provides real-time insights to address specific business questions as they arise.

🔍 Why is Ad Hoc Analysis Important?

✔ Uncovers Hidden Trends – Identifies patterns that drive business strategy.
✔ Enables Quick Decisions – Supports agile decision-making with real-time data.
✔ Enhances Business Growth – Helps solve unique challenges with data-driven insights.

During my Atliq Virtual Internship, this task provided hands-on experience in working with real-world data, analyzing trends, and making impactful decisions. Excited to apply these skills in my data analytics journey! 🚀

Sreevarshan Sivagnanam!

I’m struggling with something and need your help. We have some SQL queries created by our previous interns, and it seems they were not debugged. Can you debug them?
I've provided you with the necessary files to get started. Please download the 'gdb080.sql' file and load it into your MySQL Workbench. You can then open the 'sql_queries.docx' file to view the list of queries that you need to debug. Each query has some errors that need to be identified and fixed. Please ensure that you test each query thoroughly after fixing the errors.

This task is urgent – please complete it as soon as possible.

Best regards,
